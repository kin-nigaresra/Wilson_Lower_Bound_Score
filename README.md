# Wilson Lower Bound Score,
# Time Based Rating Average 

In this study I tried to calculate the product rating and sorting reviews more accurately. 
I have a dataset from Amazon.

## Variables:

- reviewerID (user id)
- asin (product id)
- reviewerName ( user name)
- helpful (useful rating)
- reviewText (user-written review text)
- overall (product rating)
- summary (reviewText summary)
- unixReviewTime (unix time)
- reviewTime (raw)
- day_diff (number of days since reviewTime)
- helpful_yes (number of useful)
- total_vote (total number of comments)

## First Step:
Average Rating on current reviews
calculate and with the time based average rating
compare.

## Second Step :
On the product detail page for the product
choose 20 reviews to display.
